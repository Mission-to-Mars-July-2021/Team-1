We efficiently communicated as a team to solve problems that we encountered while designing the hardware and software of the rover.

### What didn't go well
The organisation of our code and resources was not up to professional standard.

### What we will do more of tomorrow
Seek help from mentors when issues arise that we cannot rectify

### What we will do less of tomorrow
Less disorganisation and neater hardware and software.
